\title{Fix P-Values}
\usage{
fixp(x, dig = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The summary table to "fix" the p-values for}

\item{dig}{The number of digits you wish to round to}
}
\description{
A function to fix p-values in summaries for xtable. P-values should never display zero (mathematically), so this attempts to correct them. This will mostly be used for the coefficient section of summary tables from R when going into x-table
}
\details{
Thus function expects summary tables (and turns them into a data.frame). It assumes that one column of the table contains p-values (with the name Pr..., normal in many summary tables). It will shoot a warning letting you know if you are using the function with a table that doesn't have a name that starts with this. The function takes the data frame and manipulates all values that round to 0 (at the set digits) to instead display that the p-value is less than the current rounded digits outcome. Note that this makes the last column of the output dataframe either character or numeric.
}
\examples{
#this gives a summary table with a small p-value
(mod <- coef(summary(lm(uptake ~ conc + Treatment + Type + Plant, data=CO2))))

#this fixes the p-value to 2 digits, correctly reporting p-values that would have been rounded to 0
fixp(mod, dig=2)
rm(mod)
